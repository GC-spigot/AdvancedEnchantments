# Enchantment Pricing (in exp levels)
# How pricing is picked: Plugin looks at available prices in enchantment table and assigns the enchants into 3 categories
#  Pricing Categories:
#    Lowest Level - the price of enchantments below 10 levels (1-9)
#    Middle Level - the price of enchantments more than 10 levels and less than 25 (10-24)
#    Highest Level - the price of enchantments more than or equal to 25 (25-30)
#  If you assign a custom price, that price will be shown as an enchantment price in that category
# Example:
pricing:
  lowestLevel: 3-9
  middleLevel: 10-24
  highestLevel: 25-30
