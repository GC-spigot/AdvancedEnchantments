  # More advanced formula for tinkerer calculation, set to `%amount%' if you want to give a set amount (from "amount')
  # Variables:
  # %amount% = amount from previous setting
  # %enchants% = number of enchants on item
  # %durability% = percent of durability left, so if item had half of it's durability remaining, it would be 0.5
