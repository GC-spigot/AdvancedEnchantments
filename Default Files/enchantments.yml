#  Enchantment Effect List: https://ae.advancedplugins.net/enchantments/creating-enchantments/effect-list

#        # You can use tags <random word>word1,word2,word3</random word>, it will get a random word from listed words.
#        # You can use tags <random number>x-y</random number> while x < y, it will generate a random number between two given integers.
#        # e.g.: "STEAL_MONEY:<random number>10000-50000</random number>"
#        # Use <chance>x</chance> to set per-effect chance, x being a chance percentage.
#        # e.g.: "POTION:SPEED:1:100 %attacker% <chance>25</chance>"

#        # You also may use %victim% or %attacker% flag to give effects to different players (in ATTACK, BOW, DEATH, KILL_PLAYER and DEFENSE types).
#        # Example usage: - "POTION:POISON:1:50 %attacker%', this will give Level 2 POISON potion effect to the player who attacked.
#        # If none is provided, effects will be given to the player who had custom enchanted item.
#        # You can add %combo% instead of numbers, to use number of combo's player has (eg. to limit combo number: "%combo% > 0 && %combo% < 5 : %continue%')
#        # You can add %damage% instead of numbers, to use number of damage has been done (for ATTACK and DEFENSE)

#  Area of effect: https://ae.advancedplugins.net/enchantments/radius-of-effect-enchantments

#  Chance (Number)
#    Chance of effect occurring

#  Cooldown (number)
#    Number of effect cooldown, in seconds.

# Conditions
#   Conditions let you choose under what circumstances enchantment should be activated/stopped or chance increased/descreased
#
#   « Examples »
#      ► "%victim health% > 5 : %stop%" (Will not activate effects if player's health is higher than 2.5 hearts (1 heart = 2)
#      ► "%player world% = my_world : %allow%" (If player is in world called "my_world", the enchantment will activate)
#      ► "%player y% < 30 && %player health% > 10 =  : %chance%+10" (If player's Y level is less than 30 and health is more than 5 hearts, it 7
#      will increase chance of effects activating by 10)
#      ► "%victim health% > %attacker health% : %force%" (If victim has more health than attacker, effects will be forced to run
#      ignoring probability chance of it activating).
#
#   « Variables for conditional part »
#    %player health%, %player food%, %player_world%, %player_name%, %player x, %player y%, %player z%, %near players% (number)
#    You can also replace "player" with attacker/victim for ATTACK, BOW, DEATH, DEFENSE and KILL_PLAYER enchantment types.
#    %block x%, %block y% and %block z% can be used for MINING enchantment type. %combo%, %attacker combo% and %victim combo% can
#    be used to define how many combo's player has. You can also use %is sneaking% as well as %attacker is sneaking%, %victim is sneaking%
#    (eg. %is sneaking% = true : %continue%) As well as %is on fire%, can be used with %victim/attacker is on fire% (returns true/false)
#    You can use %mob type% variable for KILL_MOB and ATTACK_MOB, to get mob in the event, e.g.: (CREEPER, CAVE_SPIDER, ZOMBIE)
#    %block type% - Mined block type, find all block types at: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
#    %(victim/attacker)is under water% - returns "true/false"
#    %is headshot% - returns "true/false" (for BOW)
#    %has potion effect <POTION EFFECT TYPE>% - returns "true/false"
#    %(attacker /victim )faction land% - returns ENEMY, NEUTRAL, TRUCE, MEMBER (own land) (Factions)
#    %(attacker /victim )level of skill (mcmmo skill(UpperCase))% - returns level number (mcMMO)
#    %(attacker /victim )is bleeding% - returns "true/false" if player is bleeding (mcMMO)
#    %damaged from behind% - returns if victim was damaged from behind by enemy
#    %attacker has enchantment in hand of <enchant>% - returns "true/false", checks if player has enchantment on their item
#    %attacker time%/%victim time% - get player world time
#    %health percentage% - get player's health percentage
#    %victim/attacker custom name% - get mob's name
#    %potion effect level <potion name>% - get level of applied potion effect, remember that potion amplifiers are counted from 0, so level 1 = 0
#    %<player> can break% - checks if player can break specified block, can be used with MINING and SWING, returns true/false
#    %<player> is holding% - returns material of held item
#
# PLACHOLDERAPI SUPPORT FOR CONDITIONS:
#    E.g: "%victim player_level% > 10 : %stop%', player_level is a PlaceholderAPI condition %player_level%. You can use %player <condition>%, %attacker <condition>% and %victim <condition>%.
#    It's a must to remove percentage signs from PlaceholderAPI placeholders, more examples: %server_online% -> server_online -> "%player server_online% > 5 : %allow%"
#
#   « Variables for end solution »
#    %force% (forces effect to activate ignoring chance), %continue% (let's the effect reading continue, takes chance in consideration),
#    %stop% (ignores all of the effects), %chance%+x (increases chance by x%), %chance-x% (decreases chance by x%)
