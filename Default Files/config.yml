    # Should player automatically detect what protection plugins are used and work from there
    #   Explanation of how this works: Currently AE can support either WorldGuard only checks
    #   or Universal which will support all protection plugins but this may sometimes result in
    #   poor performance (depending on what protection plugins server is running). Recommended to
    #   leave this setting as "true" if you are using other land plugins (ie. Factions, SkyBlock, etc.)
    # Setting this to FALSE will only make the plugin work with WorldGuard
    # Setting this to TRUE will let plugin choose between WG-only or Universal method, may cause performance loss
